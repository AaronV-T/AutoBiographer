# AutoBiographer
This is an addon for WoW Classic. It is currently in development and new features are continuously being added.

## Installing

Unzip the downloaded `.zip` file and put the `AutoBiographer` folder into your AddOns directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns`).

## Features

## Current Features

The addon currently records the following events:
 - Killing a boss.
 - Deaths (including which unit killed you and their level).
 - First time entering a zone or subzone.
 - First time killing a unique unit.
 - Joining a guild, leaving a guild, or changing rank in a guild.
 - Learning a spell/ability.
 - Leveling up (including the time played at level up and total time played of each level).
 - Reaching skill milestones (75/150/225/300).
 - Turning in a quest.
 
It also keeps track of the following statistics:
 - Damage dealt and taken; healing dealt to self, healing dealt to self, healing taken.
 - Time spent in each zone (broken down into time spent AFK, casting, dead, in combat, and on flights).
 - Total kills (killing blows, assists, or group killed) for each unit.
 - Money looted.
 
My focus has been logic for event and statistic recording so the UI is currently in a very rough state. I'll eventually get around to polishing the UI but I feel that with the release of Classic so close I want the addon to be able to start recording as many events and statistics as possible.
 
## Planned Features

Events which I hope to include in the future:
 - Entering a battleground and the result of that battleground.
 - Entering a dungeon/raid.
 - First time obtaining an item.
 - Changing PVP rank.
 - Resetting talent points.
 
Statistics I would like to keep track of in the future:
 - Herbs gathered and ores mined.
 - Items bought, looted, sold, traded, etc.
 - Money gained/lost to auction house, vendors, trading to players, etc.
 - PVP stats (honorable kills, dishonorable kills, duels initiated and their results).
 - Spells cast.
