## Current Features

The addon currently records the following events:
 - Killing a boss.
 - Deaths (including which unit killed you and their level).
 - First time acquiring an item.
 - First time entering a zone or subzone.
 - First time killing a unique unit.
 - Joining a guild, leaving a guild, or changing rank in a guild.
 - Learning a spell/ability.
 - Leveling up (including the time played at level up and total time played of each level).
 - Reaching skill milestones (75/150/225/300).
 - Turning in a quest.
 
It also keeps track of the following statistics:
 - Damage dealt and taken; healing dealt to self, healing dealt to others, and healing taken.
 - Items looted or acquired by other methods.
 - Money looted and money gained from quests.
 - Time spent in each zone (broken down into time spent AFK, casting, dead, in combat, and on flights).
 - Total kills (killing blows, assists, or group killed) for each unit.

Additional Features:
 - Automatic screenshot capturing on leveling up and killing bosses.
 
## Future Features

Events:
 - Entering a battleground and the result of that battleground.
 - Entering a dungeon/raid.
 - Changing PVP rank.
 - Resetting talent points.
 
Statistics:

 The addon's current UI was quickly thrown together and I plan to redo it.
